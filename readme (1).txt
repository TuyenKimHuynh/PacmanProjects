This readme.txt will show user steps to compile the code of the Pac-man game:
Step 1: You need to get access to the github link in our project report.
Step 2: Click on "src/main/java/Pacman" folder to download java file which is Model.java and Pacman.java 
After that, move backwards to the first page and download all the gif and png file.
Step 3. Open your java IDE (Eclipse,Visual Code,IntelliJ...) and load Model.java and Pacman.java
Step 4: Click on Model.java which contains over 400 lines of code
On line 69, there is a function called loadImages which is for uploading characters's images in the game
There are already some file paths of the images on the code BUT you need to add your own file path of the png and gif file which is the location that you download these files to your computer
Step 5: After adding the images' file path, run the code and enjoy the game !!!
